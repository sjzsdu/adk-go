/*
InvocationContext represents the context of an agent invocation.

An invocation:
 1. Starts with a user message and ends with a final response.
 2. Can contain one or multiple agent calls.
 3. Is handled by runner.Run().

An invocation runs an agent until it does not request to transfer to another
agent.

An agent call:
 1. Is handled by agent.Run().
 2. Ends when agent.Run() ends.

An agent call can contain one or multiple steps.
For example, LLM agent runs steps in a loop until:
 1. A final response is generated.
 2. The agent transfers to another agent.
 3. EndInvocation() was called by the invocation context.

A step:
 1. Calls the LLM only once and yields its response.
 2. Calls the tools and yields their responses if requested.

The summarization of the function response is considered another step, since
it is another LLM call.
A step ends when it's done calling LLM and tools, or if the EndInvocation() was
called by invocation context at any time.
